    <h1>Possible things to try and do with the code</h1>
    Some suggestions will be simple and straight forward, while others are quite advanced projects. The following have been sorted
    by topic - this grouping does not reflect how easy or hard each will be to achieve...

            Enhancements to existing games:
            <div>
                There is an issue in Chrome where the 'alert' box can be displayed ahead of and block the rendering of 'document' changes
                done prior to invoking the 'alert'. This is a known issue
                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52953826/chrome-javascript-execution-sequence-problem-with-alert"
                    target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52953826/chrome-javascript-execution-sequence-problem-with-alert</a>.
                Some of the games here still suffer from this, so could change the code to use 'setTimeout' to delay the
                'alert' sufficiently to allow the rendering of 'document' changes. Using a reasonable time duration should
                not adversely affect the user experience.

                    <a href="maze.html">Maze</a>
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make it timmed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have a complexity setting
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have a local map size setting
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have objects in the maze - could do this using Windings font of different sizes so the same character displays at different
                        sizes depending on your distance from it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to indicate which paths you have already searched - could do this either with breadcrumbs or by writing on the walls
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have ability to modify the maze by breaking through or building walls
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be chased through the maze
                    </li>
                </ol>

                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Use CSS sprite image to programmatically make tiles from a single complete image
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to load your own picture for the tiles (would need the CSS sprite change to be done first)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to define the number of rows and columns (would need the CSS sprite change to be done first)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you randomly position the tiles rather than randomly do moves, will you always be able to solve the puzzle? If not, can
                        you find a better algorithm for creating a random configuration to solve than performing moves?

                        Try and connect to an online random word generator

                    <li>
                        Inplement difficulty settings (how do you determine how difficult a word is - consider number of different letters - consider
                        how frequently the word is used)

                    <li>
                        Implement right click to 'flag' a mine which would prevent you accidently clicking on that square
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find objects in the mine field - could you find power ups of extra lifes or a single use mine detector
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Additional new games:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    CSS may provide ways to rotate images so may be able to write a jigsaw game - can rotate pieces in multiples of 90 degrees,
                    and move pieces. Need to design how to attach and detach pieces.

                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Include games which require player logic:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Dr Nim
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tic-Tac-Toe (noughts and crosses)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reversi/Othello</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Other apps to write which are not necessarily games:
            <ol>
                <li>Morse Code translator </li>
                <li>Random dot stereogram generator</li>
