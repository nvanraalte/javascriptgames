    <h1>Instructions to hack this code on a Windows PC:</h1>
    The source code is held on GitHub, which has a feature whereby simple html and javascript pages can be automatically published
    on a GitHub url. Free versions of both these features are used to host this simple JavaScript powered site. The site
    and its games can be run from the following URL
    <a href="https://nvanraalte.github.io/javascriptgames">https://nvanraalte.github.io/javascriptgames</a>.
    <ol>
        <li>You will need to install GitBash. This is a command line program that runs on Windows and will let you get and update
            the source code.
            <ul>
                <li>Download GitBash from
                    <a href="https://gitforwindows.org">https://gitforwindows.org</a>.</li>
                <li>Run the download file to install GitBash. The default settings will be fine, but if you spot the one to enable
                    symlinks, it will be useful to check this one.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Next you will need to decide where you want to put the source code files on your local Windows PC to hack them.
            <ul>
                <li>In your Windows explorer, choose a directory where you want the files to go - you may want to create a new
                    folder to put them in.</li>
                <li>Right click your chosen folder and, having installed GitBash, you should see an option 'Git Bash here' -
                    select this to launch the GitBash command line tool.</li>
                <li>Type (or cut and paste) the following and click enter:
                    <br>
                    <span class="gitbash gitcommand">git checkout https://github.com/nvanraalte/javascriptgames</span>
                </li>
                <li>Once that is done use the following GitBash command to go into the new 'javascriptgames' directory:
                    <br>
                    <span class="gitbash gitcommand">cd javascriptgames</span>
                </li>
                <li>GitBash now probably shows the directory name with a '
                    <span class="gitbash gitbranch">(master)</span>' at the end. Type the following command to change to the area (the name in the brackets)
                    to the one you can use to upload your improvements to:
                    <br>
                    <span class="gitbash gitcommand">git checkout develop</span>
                </li>
                <li>In GitBash the directory should now have a '
                    <span class="gitbash gitbranch">(develop)</span>' at the end.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>To update the code you may need a GitHub account. The GitHub website is
            <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>.</li>
    </ol>
